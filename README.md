# 3DProgEngine

Some lib objects is not included in git for some reason, must be something wrong with the .gitignore (must fix)
remember to add 
	laszip_api3.dll
	laszip_api3.pdb
	laszip3.dll
	laszip3.pdb
to "out/build/x64-debug" since they aren't included with git
also add
	Obj for ObjFileData.h and other files
to "libs/assimp/code/AssetLib" since they aren't included with git either

then build all through visual studio
